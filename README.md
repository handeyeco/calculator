# Big Ass Calculator

Looking for an opportunity to build something new with React, I decided to make a stretchy calculator that would conform to whatever shape it's being displayed in. Thus my Big Ass Calculator was born! It's built with React and Sass relying heavily on CSS3's vh and vw units. To overcome problems with floating point calculations, I put together a micro-library called [sin-math](https://github.com/matthewbryancurtis/sin-math) based off of a fork from [sinful.js](http://guipn.github.io/sinful.js/).
